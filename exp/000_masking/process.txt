... Developed algo for generating not-rectangular masks.
It was really slow because of a nested for loop.

Reworked it by removing nested for loop and work with 
large vectors for indicating the mask at once rather
than accessing many entries multiple times 
(as many circles overlap).
Could maybe turn the vectors for indication into 
one set, so no duplicates are accessed (how???).

Testing the new line mask algo shows mixed results.
It is maybe worse.
Set up a benchmark test with same conditions 
(same random numbers).

Job 533087:
Commented out cuda.available before using prepdata (in train.py) 
because i suspect holgers faster algorithm will prevent OOM
errors from happening.
Converted mask from boolean to int. 
Sample size is 240000 (16*15000).
Start this job as soon as old job is done. Just inspect old job shortly.

Job 533102:
Got different error, but worse i guess. Don´t know the origin. I didn´t 
really change anything connected to that.
Try debugging with smaller sample size, so it loads faster.
Include cuda.is_available again.

Job 533182:
Neuer fehler gefixt, aber warum ist cuda.is_available so wichtig? 
Vielleicht liegt hier der grund warum das Training nicht gut läuft?
Weil vielleicht oft eine neue Batch geskippt wird.
